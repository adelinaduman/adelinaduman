### **EmotionDetect â€“ Spoken Language Advanced Processing** ðŸŽ¤
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/adelinaduman/EmotionDetectClassifier)
- Developed a sophisticated system for analyzing and recognizing emotions in spoken language.
- Used Praat, a software package for speech analysis, to extract acoustic features such as pitch, intensity, and formants.
- Employed Python for signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning model implementation.
- Implemented machine learning models like Random Forest, possibly using libraries like PyTorch or Scikit-Learn, to classify emotions based on the extracted features.
- Tech Stack: Praat, Python, PyTorch/Scikit-Learn, Signal Processing, Machine Learning
